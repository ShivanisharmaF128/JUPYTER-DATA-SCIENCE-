Objective: Demonstrating the Efficacy of Jupyter Notebook for Data Science This project aims to showcase the capabilities of Jupyter Notebook as a comprehensive tool for data science workflows. By incorporating code, visualizations, and narrative text within a single environment , we will demonstrate how Jupyter Notebook facilitates exploratory data analysis, model building, and result interpretation.

Key areas of focus will include: Interactive coding: Executing Python code and observing immediate outputs. Data visualization: Creating various plots and charts to uncover patterns and trends. Narrative integration: Explaining the code and results through descriptive text. Reproducibility: Sharing the notebook to enable others to replicate the analysis. Through this project, we will highlight the efficiency and effectiveness of Jupyter Notebook in supporting the entire data science lifecycle.

#Arthmatic expression 
consists of arithmetic terms, 
such as x, x2, xy, or 3xy2,
combined by arithmetic operations, such as 
addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
#MULTIPICATION
x = 3
y = 2
print( x*y)

#code to convert minutes in hours
def minutes_to_hours(minutes):
  """Converts minutes to hours.

  Args:
    minutes: The number of minutes to convert.

  Returns:
    The equivalent number of hours as a float.
  """

  return minutes / 60

# Example usage:
minutes = 150
hours = minutes_to_hours(minutes)
print(f"{minutes} minutes is equal to {hours} hours")
   output : 150 minutes is equal to 2.5 hours
